            <strong>This is strong text.</strong> Using the 'strong' tag is <strong>generally preferred</strong> over using the 'b' tag to bolden text.
            <em>This is emphasised text.</em> Using the 'em' tag is <em>generally preferred</em> over using the 'i' tag for italics.
        </div>
        <div id="deprec">
            <u>This is text underlined with the 'u' tag.</u> This tag, as well as 'b' and 'i' are depreciated, as these things can be achieved in CSS instead. The 'em' and 'strong' tags can also be altered in CSS so that they don't have to be <em>italicised</em> or <strong>boldened</strong> respectively
