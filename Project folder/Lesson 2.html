        <h1>Lesson 2</h1>
        <p>By default, links will open in the same tab that you're currently in, but if you want to make sure that that's what happens, put 'target="_self"' after the link, but before the end bracket.</p>
        <a href="https://learnto.codelikeagirl.com/lesson/web-dev/20c5dd90-dd28-11ea-a1b3-b325ed95f2dc/1f8dde90-ed96-11ea-a8d3-e5c01087dd56" target="_blank">This link will open in a new tab.</a>
        
        <p>Incidentally, this kind of link, which leads to somehwere else on the Internet, is called an 'absolute path'</p>
        <a href="index.html">This link is a relative path</a>
        <p>You can also link to different sections on the webpage you're currently on, but we'll demo that later when we can discuss IDs</p>
        <a href="mailto:dummy@dummy.com">This is an email link</a>
        <p></p>
        <a href="tel:0000 000 000">This is a telephone link. Useful on mobile.</a>
        <p>Both of these links above are fake, so clicking on them won't work!</p>
