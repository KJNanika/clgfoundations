        <div>
            <p>Pay attention to the part I've <em>circled in yellow.</em> Inside is an example of an ancestor-descendant selector, which means that <strong>all elements that fit the selected criteria</strong> will be affected by the CSS styling.</p>
            <p>If I were to put a > symbol in the selector between <em>div</em> and <em>p,</em> <strong>only the first paragraph in each <em>div</em> element will be affected.</strong> So this paragraph down here would use default styling instead of the style I've set, and that might be a little hard to read against this background I made (I tried my best to make it legible and it still wasn't enough, ok?)</p>
            <p>Well, it <em>should</em> work, but for some reason, <em>it doesn't</em> for me.</p>
